# Recommended System for Armut Co.

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, and transportation with a few taps on your computer or smartphone. We want to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning using a dataset that includes service users and the services and categories that these users have received.

## Business Problem
We want to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning using a data set that includes service users and the services and categories that these users have received.

#### Dataset
The dataset consists of the services received by the customers and the categories of these services. It contains the date and time information of each service received.

#### Variables:
- `UserId`: Customer number
- `ServiceId`: Anonymized services belonging to each category (Example: Sofa washing service under the cleaning category)
- `CategoryId`: Anonymized categories (Example: Cleaning, transportation, renovation category)
- `CreateDate`: Date the service was purchased

## How to Run the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/99Abdurrahman/Recommendation-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Recommendation-System
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
